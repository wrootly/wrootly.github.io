<h1>References Policy<br><br></h1>
<h5>All articles submitted to Wrootly must follow the below citation formatting guidelines else they will not be considered for publishing. If a submission has minor compliance issues, you may be contacted and asked to correct them prior to Wrootly publishing.<br><br></h5>
<p>Within an article, any sourced or otherwise unoriginal content must be attributed at the end of the relevant sentence by a bracketed reference integer which matches the source's position in the References section.</p>
<p>For example, if this Wrootly page was my only reference source, then the in-text citation would be as follows:</p>
<p><b>According to the Wrootly References Policy, "any sourced or otherwise unoriginal content must be attributed" by a bracketed number at the end of the sentence [1].</b></p>
<p>Within the References section, sources are listed line-by-line using the following format:<br>[#] Author Last Name, Author First Name. Content Title (if applicable). Content Type (Web, In-Person, Print). Content URL (if applicable).</p>
<p>Therefore, the citation for the above example would be as follows:</p>
<p><b>[1] Quigley, Kevin. References Policy. Web. http://wrootly.com/submit/references/</b></p>
<p>When citing multiple sources, list the items in alphabetical order from top to bottom, regardless of which is the first available parameter. For example,</p>
<p><b>[1] Brown, John. A History of Common Names. Print.<br>[2] Google. Web. https://www.google.com/<br>[3] Quigley, Kevin. References Policy. Web. http://wrootly.com/submit/references/</b></p>
