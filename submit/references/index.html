<h1>References Policy<br><br></h1>
<h5>All articles submitted to Wrootly must follow the below citation formatting guidelines else they will not be considered for publishing. If a submission has minor compliance issues, you may be contacted and asked to correct them prior to Wrootly publishing.<br><br></h5>
<p>Within an article, any sourced or otherwise unoriginal content must be attributed at the end of the relevant sentence by a bracketed reference integer which matches the source's position in the References section.</p>
<p>For example, if this Wrootly page was my only reference source, then the in-text citation would be as follows:</p>
<p><b>According to the Wrootly References Policy, "any sourced or otherwise unoriginal content must be attributed" by a bracketed number at the end of the sentence [1].</b></p>
