<h1>Twitter and the Presidential Tone<br></h1>

<p><br>In an increasingly connected world, the differing opinions present in our nation have become more transparently exposed and have created new opportunities for immediate public discussion and debate. Among the most prevalent topics of these discussions is US President Donald J. Trump and the actions of his administration. Specifically, both supporters and non-supporters of President Trump have taken special notice of his Twitter activity.</p>
<p>President Trump has repeatedly communicated that he feels media organizations are dishonest and report biasedly on stories about him, thus forcing him to use Twitter as a direct channel to connect with the American public. For example, on December 30, 2017, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/947235015343202304">the President tweeted</a></p>
<p><i>“I use Social Media not because I like to, but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair “press,” now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. Many stories & reports a pure fiction!”</i> [4].</p>
<p>In addition to feeling that the press is “dishonest and unfair,” President Trump believes that news outlets deliberately do not report on events which might make him look favorable. On January 4, 2018 <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949129410208202757">he tweeted</a></p>
<p><i>“The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U.S. is booming...but the people know! Can you imagine if “O” was president and had these numbers - would be biggest story on earth! Dow now over 25,000.”</i> [4].</p>
<p>Similarly, on January 2, 2018 <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948359545767841792">he tweeted</a></p>
<p><i>“I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned!”</i> [4].</p>
<p>In contrast to President Trump’s beliefs, many Twitter users feel that the President is too reckless on Twitter and thus should be banned. In response to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948194400114487296">one of the President’s tweets</a>referring to Kim Jung Un, the leader of North Korea, as “Rocket man,” one user replied</p>
<p><i>“Perhaps you also shouldn't be turning to Twitter to express your emotions about this man who seems to really get under your skin?”</i></p>
<p>while another user stated</p>
<p><i>“He still hates you and the united srares [States] but keep making it worse by calling him juvenile names & undercutting diplomacy efforts! #TimeToGoToddler #25thAmendmentNow”</i> [4].</p>
<p>Heated responses both for and against the President can be found in reply to most of his tweets, and it is worth noting that a majority of these responses are from unconfirmed accounts which are subject to the possibility of spam, bots, international interference, or any number of non-credible sources.</p>
<p>As a result, Politico reports, Twitter recently responded to calls to ban the President from their platform, stating</p>
<p><i>“Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate”</i> [2].</p>
<p>The primary concern of those who criticize President Trump’s Twitter usage seems to be less that he is using Twitter to communicate and more about the atypical tone of his content. While many politicians use Twitter, they generally publish a professional and polished message, such as Senator John McCain <a href="https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/949325850406727680">who tweeted</a></p>
<p><i>“I welcome the administration’s decision to sanction Iranian entities responsible for ballistic missile development. This action is an important step forward in holding #Iran accountable for its destabilizing activities in the region.”</i> [3].</p>
<p>President Trump’s tweets, however, tend to carry a less formal tone and often read more as stream of consciousness. For example, on October 19, 2017, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/920966294035451904">he tweeted</a></p>
<p><i>“Republicans are going for the big Budget approval today, first step toward massive tax cuts. I think we have the votes, but who knows?”</i></p>
<p>and on January 6, 2018, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949618475877765120">he tweeted</a></p>
<p><i>“ ....Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star.....”</i> [4].</p>
<p>In response to one of the President’s tweets which claims that his “Nuclear Button” is “a much bigger & more powerful one than” than Kim Jung Un’s, Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania <a href="https://twitter.com/SenBobCasey/status/948557784513241088">tweeted</a></p>
<p><i>“This is exactly the kind of reckless behavior I was hoping we would avoid in 2018. Please Mr. President, no more diplomacy via twitter.”</i> [1].</p>
<p>Delivering frequent typos, irregular capitalization and punctuation choices, informal tone, provocative messaging, unique nicknames and abbreviations, open and personalized criticisms, and an uncensored portrayal of his controversial opinions, President Trump’s Twitter activity has captured the attention of news outlets and global citizens alike. Although supporters appreciate the unfiltered access which the President claims to provide using Twitter while non-supporters criticize the tone and content of his tweets, both are staying aware and interested.</p>
<p>For those who may still be undecided about their opinion of the President’s use of Twitter, if you feel the need to have an opinion about it at all, I offer an additional small selection of tweets which I noted as dissimilar to other political standards in some manner.</p>
